# Archived Docs

This directory stores historical and generated materials that are not part of the active runbooks.

## Contents

- `audit-snapshots/`: point-in-time audit artifacts (lint/test outputs, duplicate reports, file inventories).
- `*_SUMMARY.md` files: historical implementation summaries preserved for reference.

Active operational documentation remains under `docs/` root.
